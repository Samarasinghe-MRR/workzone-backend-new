# üîß Dependency Injection Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem Description
```
Error: Nest can't resolve dependencies of the CentralizedAuthGuard (?). 
Please make sure that the argument AuthClientService at index [0] is available in the QuotationModule context.
```

## Root Cause
The `CentralizedAuthGuard` in the `QuotationController` needed `AuthClientService`, but the `AuthModule` wasn't properly available to the `QuotationModule`.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Made AuthModule Global
```typescript
// src/auth/auth.module.ts
@Global()  // ‚Üê Added this decorator
@Module({
  providers: [AuthClientService, CentralizedAuthGuard],
  exports: [AuthClientService, CentralizedAuthGuard],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

### 2. Module Import Structure
```
AppModule
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthModule (Global) ‚Üê Available everywhere
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PrismaModule
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventsModule
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ QuotationModule ‚Üê Can now use AuthClientService
```

### 3. Dependency Flow
```
QuotationController
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @UseGuards(CentralizedAuthGuard)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constructor(AuthClientService) ‚Üê Now resolved successfully
```

## Results ‚úÖ

### Service Successfully Started
- ‚úÖ All dependencies initialized
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ All routes mapped correctly
- ‚úÖ RabbitMQ microservice connected
- ‚úÖ Running on port 3004

### Routes Mapped Successfully
```
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/provider/quotes, POST} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/provider/quotes, GET} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/provider/quotes/:id, PATCH} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/provider/quotes/:id, DELETE} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/provider/metrics, GET} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/customer/jobs/:jobId/quotes, GET} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/customer/quotes/:id, GET} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/customer/quotes/:id/accept, POST} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/quotation/customer/quotes/:id/reject, POST} route
```

## Key Learning üìö

### Global Modules in NestJS
When you have services that need to be used across multiple modules (like authentication), you have two options:

1. **Import the module everywhere** (can lead to circular dependencies)
2. **Make the module global** with `@Global()` decorator ‚Üê Better for auth, config, etc.

### Best Practice
```typescript
// Common services that are used everywhere should be global
@Global()
@Module({
  providers: [AuthService, LoggerService, ConfigService],
  exports: [AuthService, LoggerService, ConfigService],
})
export class CoreModule {}
```

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
The Quotation Service is now running successfully with centralized authentication working properly!
